50 mmag in the v band . additionally , polaris is not even constant in its inconstancy , as both the pulsation period and the pulsation amplitude have changed in the past . \\n the amplitude in particular has changed substantially and is currently still changing , as we will describe in this paper . \\n polaris is an important star for a number of reasons \\n it is the nearest cepheid variable and a star where we can see stellar evolution taking place . \\n understanding the location of polaris on the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( and particularly the relationship of polaris to the instability strip ; whether it is a star undergoing its first or third or even fifth crossing ) and the nature of the pulsations ( whether fundamental model or an overtone pulsator ) are all important questions in stellar evolution . \\n the first evidence suggesting the variable nature of polaris was presented 150 years ago @xcite with strong confirmation , along with the correct period , being supplied by @xcite via radial velocity measurements . \\n photometric detection of the pulsations were presented several years afterwards @xcite . \\n a large number of observations have have been made in the intervening years , which have helped to build a picture of how the star has been evolving over the last century and a half . despite this \\n , there is still a great deal of interest in polaris due to the changes in the period and amplitude of the oscillations , as well as unusual events such as the change from a steady decline in amplitude to a very rapid decline from 0.1 mag to @xmath30.02 mag during the 1960 s . during this time \\n , the period also readjusted downwards . \\n the rate of period change is an important diagnostic tool for determining which crossing of the instability strip a cepheid is undergoing . \\n the recent analysis of the o - c residuals of polaris by @xcite has led to the suggestion that the period of polaris is currently increasing at a rate of 4.5 s yr@xmath1 . \\n this rate of period change is unusual for a cepheid with this period and adds to the confusion as to what stage of its evolution polaris is actually at . in the following sections we present new smei photometric observations of polaris , \\n discuss the amplitude changes that we observe during the course of the observations and also look at the o - c residuals and interpret these in the light of recent measurements of the period . \\n the new photometry we present was obtained using the smei instrument on board the usaf coriolis spacecraft , which was launched in january 2003 into an 840  km sun - synchronous polar orbit with an orbital period of 101 minutes . \\n smei consists of 3 cameras , each with a field of view of @xmath4 , which monitors nearly the entire sky over one orbit . \\n consequently , we obtain data for polaris on essentially every orbital pass . \\n smei has a roughly triangular pass band with a peak quantum efficiency of 47% at 700 nm and falling to 5% at 430 nm and 1025 nm . \\n although smei is a small instrument , the fact that it has monitored the entire sky with a cadence of @xmath5 minutes for over 4 years , results in stellar light curves , for bright stars , that are unprecedented . \\n an overview of the smei instrument can be found in @xcite , and an overview of stellar variability results being obtained with smei will be presented in @xcite . \\n smei results on the variability of the red giant arcturus can be found in @xcite . \\n the polaris data spans from april 2003 to october 2007 , with a 70% fill throughout this period of time , giving us an exceptional data sample to investigate the period and amplitude variations of the 3.97 day oscillations exhibited by polaris . \\n the full details of the reduction pipeline for generating time - series from the smei data will be presented in @xcite , so we only discuss the data reduction briefly here . \\n the raw images obtained by the smei instrument are bias subtracted , have a temperature scaled dark current signal removed , and are flat fielded . \\n hot pixels and high energy particle hits are corrected on the images via interpolation , before aperture photometry is performed . \\n the resulting light curves are corrected for systematic effects resulting from the variation of the psf as it moves across the ccd and vignetting / optical effects . removing a best fit sine curve from the entirety of the dataset highlighted non - regular systematic variations at the few mmag level which we have largely removed using a smoothed box car average obtained with a window width of @xmath312 days . \\n we finally removed a number of spurious data points from the data , which were primarily due to uncorrected cosmic rays , by performing a 3 sigma clip on short 28 day sections of data from which the best fitting sinusoidal relation for each section had been removed . \\n the resulting time series can be seen in fig . \\n [ timeseries ] along with a closer view of a section of data taken from 13th september 2006 to 29th november 2006 , which highlights the level of precision we are able to attain over a long baseline . \\n in order to study the amplitude of the 3.97 day ( 2.914@xmath6hz ) oscillation we have generated fourier spectra of both long ( 8 - 9 months ) and short ( 28 day ) sections of the time series data . \\n the resulting trend from computing the mean amplitude in each data chunk is shown in fig . \\n [ three_epoch ] and fig . \\n [ monthly_fft ] . to create the fourier spectra , we first subtracted a robust mean from the time series and the residuals were then converted to a change in magnitude relative to the mean magnitude . after computing the fourier spectra we ensured that in every case the power corresponding to the 3.97 day oscillation was restricted to a single bin , and padding the data with zeros to artificially enhance the resolution of the fourier spectra had no effect on the computed amplitudes . \\n = 5.8 cm    = 5.75 cm    fig . \\n [ three_epoch ] shows the 2.914 @xmath6hz peak in the fourier spectra for three @xmath39 month sections of the light curve . \\n the peaks for the 2003 and 2004 - 2005 data have been offset by @xmath70.8 and @xmath70.4 @xmath6hz respectively to highlight the increase in the amplitude over time . \\n on the assumption that polaris is oscillating in the first overtone mode ( see section 4 ) , we do not detect any significant power at the expected frequency for the fundamental mode , i.e. @xmath8hz . the trend of the increasing amplitude is highlighted more clearly in fig . \\n [ monthly_fft ] where we have plotted the mean amplitude calculated in consecutive 28 day chunks of data . \\n each 28 day section contained 400 data points after data gaps had been filled with zero values . \\n the best fitting linear relation describing the rate of increase for the peak to peak amplitude is @xmath9 mmag yr@xmath1 . \\n some of the scatter in the plot is attributed to the varying amplitude of the oscillations , which @xcite also saw in wire observations , and suggested it could be due to the analogue of the blazkho effect in cepheids . in our analysis , however , we do not see any significant periodic variations in the amplitude above a level of @xmath10  mmag appearing consistently throughout the observations . \\n this is to our knowledge the first highly confident detection of the amplitude increase over the last few years from photometric measurements , although some hint has been given previously @xcite . \\n this completely contradicts the claim that polaris is about to cease its variability and leave the instability strip @xcite , although this was based somewhat on an erroneous result . \\n .recent measurements of the period of polaris suggest that it has undergone another recent decline . \\n there seems to have been a large decline between 1988 and 1993 , with the rate slowing in the last ten years . in total , the period has reduced by around 200 seconds over the last 20 years.[periods ] [ cols=\\\"^ , < , < \\\" , ]     the o - c residuals obtained from @xcite , along with the new values calculated from our data are plotted in fig . \\n we have used the same time regimes as this paper ( i.e. pre-1963 and post 1965 ) to determine our rate of period change . the best fitting parabolic relation for observations before 1963 , as determined by @xcite , provides an estimate for the rate of period increase over this time of @xmath11 s yr@xmath1 the best fitting parabolic relation for the data since 1963 , with the inclusion of our new measurements suggests the mean rate of increase for the period has increased to @xmath2 s yr@xmath1 this relation is again shown in fig . \\n [ oc ] . ignoring the data from 1966 , as in @xcite , insignificantly alters the value to @xmath12 s yr@xmath1 . ignoring the datum from 1965 \\n , however , causes a dramatic change to the calculated value , giving instead @xmath13 s yr@xmath14 . \\n it is clear therefore that the mean rate of period increase over the last 50 years has been between 4.4 and 5 s yr@xmath1 , consistent with the rate before 1963 . \\n if one looks more closely at recent measurements for the period , however , it does appear that it may have recently undergone a rapid decline , similar to that seen in the early 1960 s . \\n table  [ periods ] shows the period as measured several times over the last 20 years with the values obtained from @xcite and references therein , together with the period measured from our new results . \\n the decline is very evident , and amounts to a decrease of around 200 seconds during the last 20 years , but the rate has been much slower over the last ten years than it was between 1987 and 1997 . additionally , although our results are fairly consistent with a period increase of 4.9  s  yr@xmath1 , they do follow a slightly shallower trend which is likely due to the recent decrease in period . \\n we will now discuss these results in the context of stellar evolution and ascertain what implications they have on the evolutionary stage of polaris . \\n there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that polaris is a first overtone ( s - cepheid ) oscillator . \\n @xcite used the hipparcos parallax ( measured to be @xmath15  mas for polaris ) to fit period - luminosity models to a sample of cepheids and concluded that the best fit for polaris resulted if it was treated as a first overtone pulsator . \\n the updated value for the hipparcos parallax of polaris is @xmath16  mas @xcite , therefore this conclusion is still valid . \\n @xcite used interferometry to measure the radius of polaris to be @xmath17 , and again this is only consistent with the pulsation period if polaris is a first overtone pulsator . \\n the mean rate of change of the period and the small amplitude of the oscillations are also indicators that polaris oscillates in an overtone mode . \\n combining this with the fact that polaris exhibits a highly symmetrical light curve , it exhibits all of the features we expect from s - cepheids . \\n = 5.8 cm    = 5.65 cm    @xcite suggest that polaris exists at the cool edge of the region of the instability strip occupied by the s - cepheids , but that the positive period change could not be due to evolution as the star would be evolving towards the centre of the instability strip , which would defy the previously declining amplitude . @xcite \\n also place polaris on the red edge of the instability strip for putative first crossers , which corresponds to the s - cepheid red edge in this case . \\n they do however suggest the possibility of polaris being a fundamental pulsator , which is unlikely given the evidence above . \\n @xcite on the other hand believed that polaris was about to evolve out of the instability strip completely , which would require it to be near the edge of the instability strip , which it certainly does not appear to be . \\n the behaviour we are now seeing from polaris is consistent with what we expect from a cepheid located in the instability strip where @xcite and @xcite suggest , but the conclusion that the period change is not due to evolution may be incorrect . \\n = 7.9 cm    firstly , consider the evidence that the period has once again undergone a rapid decline , which could be a phase of blueward evolution , as @xcite suggests could be the case for the 1963 - 66 period readjustment . \\n secondly , the amplitude appeared to cease its decline in the early 1990s , and is now seemingly increasing again . \\n one might expect to see such behaviour if polaris was undergoing an evolutionary change in its oscillation mode . \\n if we look at the models for s - cepheids produced by @xcite , and specifically look at the location of polaris in the computed instability regimes then , as fig . \\n [ ismodel ] shows , polaris lies on the red edge of the overtone instability strip for their non - linear convective model , which is able to generate light and radial velocity curves very similar to those found observationally . if the true red edge of the first overtone instability strip lies close to the one computed in this fbk model , then polaris is in fact undergoing a change from being a first overtone pulsator ( assuming it is evolving to the cooler side of the instability strip ) to becoming either a fundamental pulsator or a double mode pulsator . \\n the position of polaris in fig . \\n [ ismodel ] suggests that its mass is not quite great enough to enter the fundamental pulsator regime , which occurs for masses greater than around @xmath18 ( the knee in the model track ) , but recent measurements by @xcite for example , do not place enough of a constraint on the mass to make an absolute determination as to which regime polaris will enter . \\n if polaris is about to cross into another pulsation regime , then we might expect to see occasional blips in the period as this readjustment phase takes place . \\n finally , the crossing mode of polaris is also uncertain . \\n @xcite suggest that despite polaris exhibiting a deficiency of carbon and an over - abundance of nitrogen @xcite , this can not be interpreted in any fashion to determine the crossing mode , such as was done by @xcite . \\n somewhat controversially , @xcite suggests that polaris has a small over - abundance of carbon , which would certainly place it in a first crossing scenario . \\n the rate of period change for cepheids is an indicator of the crossing mode @xcite . \\n if we assume polaris to be oscillating in the first overtone mode , and take the rate of period change over the last 150 years to be + 4.5 s yr@xmath1 , then this is a factor of @xmath33 too small for a first crossing cepheid and about the same factor too large for a third crossing cepheid . \\n @xcite suggest that the observable characteristics of polaris are most consistent with a first time crosser . \\n interestingly , however , if one only considers the trend in the period from the last 20 years , then we see a decline at a rate of @xmath19 s yr@xmath1 . \\n this is actually consistent with a first overtone cepheid undergoing its second crossing . \\n the possibility that polaris is in its second crossing was also discussed by @xcite . \\n we must be cautious , however , as the rate over the last fourteen years , using measurements with much better precision than those presented in @xcite , only suggest a decline of @xmath20 s yr@xmath1 . \\n clearly , it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions on the crossing mode at present . \\n the new results obtained with smei strongly suggest the amplitude of polaris is once again increasing \\n . the star does seem to be oscillating in the first overtone mode , but likely lies close to the red edge of the instability strip for s - cepheids , and is therefore likely to soon evolve into either a fundamental or double - mode pulsation cepheid , assuming the cepheid is undergoing its first or third crossing . \\n it is uncertain how quickly polaris will evolve across the boundary between pulsation regimes and what behaviour the cepheid will exhibit as it does so . \\n one slight oddity in the results is the lack of evidence for the fundamental mode of oscillation being present , but this may appear in the near future . \\n it is therefore crucial that high precision monitoring of this star is continued for the foreseeable future so that the changes can be watched closely . \\n we would like to thank the referee , clifton laney , for his extremely useful comments , which have helped improve this paper . \\n sas acknowledges support from stfc and the school of physics and astronomy , university of birmingham . \\n smei was designed and built by members of ucsd , afrl , and the university of birmingham . \\n we particularly thank yvonne elsworth , andrew buffington , chris eyles and james tappin .\",\n          \"in the presence of noise and perturbations , the information stored in quantum systems is typically lost . indeed , orthogonal states ( or their superpositions ) \\n may evolve into similar states , so that even when the perturbation is known it is impossible to restore the original one . \\n @xcite however , the rate at which information corrupts depends on how it is actually encoded , on the nature of the perturbations , as well as on the properties of the system . in particular , in the case of a many - body system , this rate may depend on its size : for the larger hilbert space there is `` more space '' to keep the states distinguishable . \\n systems possessing this property for naturally occurring perturbations may serve as quantum memories ,  @xcite which can reliably store quantum states for long times .    in this article \\n , we investigate the capability of a kitaev chain  @xcite to store quantum states in the presence of noise . \\n we consider the encoding of a qubit in the zero - energy majorana modes of a kitaev chain described by hamiltonian @xmath0 and analyze the loss of information occurring when the time evolution describing the storage period is dictated by a different hamiltonian , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is an unknown perturbation . \\n we explicitly focus on time - dependent quadratic perturbations containing high frequencies and find that the quantum memory can be robust to a wide range of perturbations . \\n specifically , even though perturbations spread the qubit in the whole hilbert space and the average over several @xmath3 is considered , the orthogonality of any pair of initial states is preserved for very long times : the rate at which the information is lost decreases exponentially with the system size . \\n the potential use as quantum memories of kitaev chains  @xcite and of other topological systems  @xcite has been extensively studied in recent years , following the seminal work by kitaev . \\n @xcite most of the prior work has focused on analyzing systems with topological order , whereby the degeneracy of the ground state subspace is stable under small local perturbations  @xcite with frequencies well below the characteristic energy gap . \\n this ensures that all of the ground states of the perturbed hamiltonian have a trivial evolution so that , when encoded in these ground states , the information can survive for long times . \\n in contrast , here we consider the situation when highly excited states are created due to sudden quench perturbations with high - frequency excitations above the gap . \\n @xcite in such cases , conventional topological protection is no longer effective . \\n @xcite    our work is closely connected to the use of topological systems as error correcting codes in the context of self - protected quantum memories . \\n @xcite however , in contrast to previous investigations , we do not consider a specific error correction procedure ,  @xcite but rather analyze whether the information is still present `` somewhere '' in the hilbert space . \\n in fact , our analysis shows that the memory time grows exponentially with the system size in situations where previous approaches give a negative result . \\n besides , our results may bear an interesting connection to the phenomenon of many - body localization  @xcite , whereby different initial states remain distinguishable for arbitrarily long times under a quench .    in this article \\n we introduce a series of theoretical tools to analyze the loss of quantum information encoded in many - body systems and characterize the optimal procedure to decode it . in a quantum - memory framework , we quantify the amount of information that may be recovered after the storage period and evaluate it , as well as its upper and lower bounds , for different relevant cases . for the problem of interest \\n , our numerical methods can investigate relatively large systems , and the appropriate size - scalings are derived . \\n we identify the conditions for a memory time that scales exponentially with the system size and study how this exponential dependence is affected by finite temperatures , or by the particle exchange between the chain and a reservoir . \\n this article is organized as follows . in sec . \\n [ sec : setup ] we review the theory of a quantum memory based on the majorana modes of two kitaev chains , and set up the notation . in sec . \\n [ sec : rec : of : info ] we present the theory of the optimal recoverability of the information , both for general and for gaussian recovery operations . in sec . \\n [ sec : result ] we present the main result of the article , namely the fact that a quantum memory based on the kitaev chain can withstand a sudden quench perturbation . in sec . \\n [ sec : discussion ] we further elaborate on it , and the effect of temperature and particle losses is considered . finally , in sec .  [ sec : conc ] we present our conclusions . \\n we consider a kitaev chain of @xmath4 majorana ( real ) modes , @xmath5 , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 . \\n the hamiltonian is :  @xcite @xmath8 at zero temperature , it has a topological phase for @xmath9 and the ground state is quasi - degenerate due to the existence of ( nearly ) zero energy majorana modes , @xmath10 , localized at the edges . \\n they can be expressed as linear combinations of the @xmath11 , and can be used to define a dirac mode @xmath12 . due to superselection rules on the parity of the number of fermions , two such dirac modes \\n are necessary in order to define a meaningful qubit . \\n thus , we consider a second kitaev chain , whose zero - energy majorana modes are @xmath13 , and which define a dirac mode @xmath14 . \\n we define a qubit in the even parity sector of the model : @xmath15 and construct a set of pauli operators : @xmath16 results would be identical , apart from notation , in the odd sector : @xmath17 . \\n is encoded into a topological system of size @xmath18 and stored for a time @xmath19 . \\n perturbations act on the system during the storage and induce a non - unitary time - evolution that destroys the encoded information . \\n we model this process with a decoherence channel @xmath20 . \\n a recovery operation attempts at retrieving the information and reconstructs a qubit @xmath21 which should be as similar as possible to @xmath22 . ]    when the hamiltonian is perturbed or there is an interaction with the environment , the chain undergoes a non - trivial dynamics . \\n let us denote by @xmath23 the _ decoherence channel _ that describes the encoding of a qubit into the ground state of the chains and the subsequent time - evolution which describes the storage of the information ( see fig . \\n [ fig : sketch ] ) . \\n note that the latter takes into account both the hamiltonian part of the time evolution and the non - unitary action of perturbations . \\n the decoherence channel maps the state of the qubit onto the state of the two chains ; therefore , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a qubit density operator and @xmath26 is the state of the chains at time @xmath19 . \\n @xmath27 thus represents the many - body state where the information is encoded and it must always fulfill @xmath28 , where @xmath29 are the usual pauli matrices and the @xmath30 are defined in  . these conditions do not define @xmath27 uniquely ; where not explicitly stated , we will consider : @xmath31 where operators @xmath32 diagonalize the total hamiltonian and @xmath33 labels those modes which have non - zero energy ; @xmath34 is a properly chosen constant .    in order to simplify the discussion , we assume that the chains are kept far apart , so that they do not interact with each other or with the same environment . \\n moreover , throughout the article we assume that the first dirac mode , @xmath35 , does not undergo any dynamics , neither hamiltonian nor dissipative , as in general only the relative time evolution of the two chains contributes to the corruption of the information . in this setting \\n there is no need to keep track of the modes of the first chain different from @xmath35 . \\n after the storage time @xmath19 , the attempt to retrieve the initial qubit is described by the _ recovery channel _ , @xmath36 , which maps back the chain and the extra fermionic mode , @xmath35 , to a qubit ( see fig .  [ \\n fig : sketch ] ) . \\n it has to be chosen such that the composite channel @xmath37 is as close as possible to the identity channel . \\n this can be quantified with the _ recovery fidelity _ :  @xcite @xmath38 where the integral is over the surface of the bloch sphere .    in appendix  [ appendix1 ] \\n we demonstrate that , given a decoherence channel , the optimal fidelity @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 are the ( pure ) eigenstates of @xmath43 with eigenvalues @xmath44 , and @xmath45 denotes the trace norm , i.e. the sum of the singular values of the operator . \\n .   shows that @xmath39 depends on the distance @xmath46 between two many - body states which result from the time evolution of two orthogonal qubit states . at @xmath47 , @xmath48 but it decreases with time due to noise and perturbations , and no physical operation can increase it again because of the contractivity of the trace norm . \\n @xcite    in appendix  [ appendix1 ] we also characterize the properties of the _ optimal recovery operation _ @xmath49 that saturates the bound @xmath50 of eq .  . \\n this @xmath49 consists in the measurement on @xmath51 of three many - body observables @xmath52 , that ( i ) essentially undo the rotation that the axes of the original qubit @xmath53 have undergone , and ( ii ) quantify the distance between pairs of initially orthogonal states aligned on them . \\n indeed , they are chosen so that @xmath54   \\\\doteqdot \\\\| \\\\mathcal d_t ( \\\\hat \\\\sigma_\\\\alpha)\\\\|_{\\\\text{tr}}= 2 d ( \\\\hat \\\\rho_{\\\\alpha,+}(t ) , \\\\hat \\\\rho_{\\\\alpha,-}(t ) ) $ ] , where we applied the linearity of @xmath55 on the eigenstates @xmath56 of @xmath57 : @xmath58 + \\\\frac{1}{2 } \\\\sum_\\\\alpha \\\\hat \\\\sigma_\\\\alpha \\\\,{\\\\text{tr}}\\\\left[\\\\hat h_\\\\alpha\\\\hat \\\\rho ( t ) \\\\right].\\\\ ] ] alternatively , the optimal recovery operation can be thought of as a two - step procedure : the first being a unitary acting over the global hilbert space that attempts to align back the image of the bloch sphere , and the second a trace on all the fermionic modes different from @xmath35 and @xmath59 , where the initial qubit was defined and the recovered one is recreated . notice that the unitary ( defined in terms of @xmath52 s ) may involve @xmath18-body terms acting on all the fermionic modes of the chain and the specific form depends on the singular value decomposition of @xmath60 .    because the optimal recovery operation can be difficult to implement in practice , it is natural to restrict the optimization of @xmath61 to those physical actions that can be operatively realized . \\n those actions depend on the specific experimental setup and should be independently studied for each physical implementation . here \\n we consider as experimentally - relevant recovery operations those which are fermionic gaussian channels . \\n @xcite they comprise the addition and discard of auxiliary modes , the time evolution under quadratic hamiltonians and under master equations with linear jump operators ( see appendix  [ sec : fgstates ] for a short introduction ) . in appendix  [ appendix2 ] \\n we show that the best recovery fidelity attainable with a fermionic gaussian channel is : @xmath62 here , @xmath63 are the covariance matrices ( cm ) of @xmath64 , defined as @xmath65_{j , k } \\\\doteqdot i \\\\text{tr } [ \\\\hat \\\\rho_\\\\pm ( t ) \\\\hat c_j \\\\hat c_k]$ ] . \\n the @xmath66 denotes the operator norm , i.e. the largest singular value of the operator . \\n similarly to the previous case , it is possible to characterize the properties of the _ optimal gaussian recovery operation _ that achieves @xmath67 ( see appendix  [ appendix2 ] ) . \\n , @xmath68 and : ( a , c ) @xmath69 , @xmath70 ;

[ ] ) . \\n our analysis shows that , even if the standard techniques to correct errors fail , the qubit is still intact and can be recovered with the optimal recovery operation . \\n the stability of the memory can be traced back to the fact that for any pair of hamiltonians @xmath126 it holds that : @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the two ground states for the original hamiltonian , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 denotes equality apart for a term decaying exponentially with @xmath18 . \\n indeed , in appendix  [ app : ham : pert ] we define the @xmath132 matrices @xmath133 and \\n @xmath134 : @xmath135_{j , k } =    { \\\\langle \\\\tau| } e^{i   \\\\hat h_j t } e^{-i \\\\hat h_kt } { |\\\\tau\\\\rangle } , \\\\ ;

plotted values for @xmath145 are obtained via scaling as @xmath146 ( see appendix  [ app : ham : pert ] ) . ]      from the previous discussion , it may appear that the exact distribution of the parameters corresponding to the possible perturbations is necessary in order to implement the `` correct '' best recovery operation , as formulated in eq .  . \\n interestingly , instead , we can show that only a coarse knowledge of the interval @xmath147 of possible values is sufficient , as long as it includes the real one @xmath148 , to obtain a recovery whose quality ( in terms of fidelity or storage time ) increments exponentially with the size @xmath18 of the physical system .    for the sake of simplicity \\n , we consider the case where only one parameter ( e.g. , the chemical potential @xmath121 ) varies according to box distributions in @xmath147 and @xmath149 , but generalizations on both hypothesis would be straightforward . \\n let us call @xmath150 and @xmath151 the decoherence channels associated with the noise model as in eq .  , @xmath152 and @xmath153 their outcomes descending from the pure state input @xmath22 , and @xmath154 the absolute best recovery operation for @xmath155 computed by making use of eq .  . \\n by definition , we know that @xmath156 , with @xmath157 scaling exponentially with the size @xmath18 . in appendix  [ app : prior ] we show that @xmath158 , where @xmath159 , a bound that also scales exponentially with the size @xmath18 . \\n thus , the application of @xmath154 after the action of @xmath160 defines a memory time that , though not absolute best , still increases exponentially with the size of the system . \\n it is therefore demonstrated that one does not need a fine - tuned knowledge of the perturbation ( and therefore of the absolute optimal @xmath161 ) in order to gain exponential protection of the qubit storage . \\n so far , we considered only perturbations preserving the quadratic character of the hamiltonian \\n . it would be interesting to analyze whether the exponential scaling persists even in the presence of more general perturbations , and in particular of interactions . \\n although such a study is outside the scope of the present work because it requires the use of different numerical techniques , we believe that interactions may not lead to a dramatic change of the picture arising from the previous discussion . \\n indeed , time evolution in presence of interactions can be considered within the generalized bogoliubov theory . \\n @xcite the result is a non - linear problem that can be mapped onto a quadratic time - dependent hamiltonian whose coefficients depend on the state which is evolved in time . remarkably , such time - dependent hamiltonian has the form of those investigated above , so that we still expect the memory time to increase with the system size .     and the figure shows the upper bound as a function of time for different lengths of the chain @xmath162 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 . \\n ( right ) size is fixed : @xmath163 and the figure shows the upper bound as a function of time for different temperatures @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 . \\n we take @xmath169 realizations . ] \\n we next examine memory performance for the restricted set of gaussian recovery operations . \\n [ fig : gaussianrecovery ] displays the optimal gaussian fidelity in the presence of the same perturbations as in fig . \\n [ fig : decomap : unknownham](a ) : the fidelity improves with the size of the system but saturates for sufficiently large @xmath18 . \\n remarkably , similar results are obtained when the encoding is performed in the state of the second chain where all of the non - zero modes are initially in thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath170 : @xmath171}.\\\\ ] ] operators @xmath172 diagonalize @xmath0 and @xmath173 is the corresponding energy ; @xmath174 and @xmath175 .    because we deal with convex combinations of mixed states \\n , we can only plot an upper bound @xmath176 to the optimal fidelity  ( see appendix  [ app : ham : pert ] ) , which we observed to be very close to the exact value in cases in which the latter was computable ( not shown ) . for temperatures above the gap , fig . \\n [ fig : decomap : temperature ]  ( left ) displays a clear saturation behavior . for temperatures below the gap , our results are not conclusive ( not shown ) , even if lowering the temperature keeping a fixed value of @xmath18 clearly increases the saturation bound , as shown in fig . \\n [ fig : decomap : temperature ]  ( right ) . \\n thus , it appears that the temperature defines an effective system size up to which topological protection can occur . \\n these results can be understood as follows : ( i ) although each term in the integral   is gaussian , its sum ( convex combination ) is not , and thus the density operator is not gaussian either ;

zero angle of attack , is given in appendix  [ sec : chordw - mach - numb ] . \\n the time averaged psd is obtained by averaging the instantaneous psd , i.e. equation  , over one rotation of the rotor . since the instantaneous psd is a function of source time @xmath22 , the time increment @xmath256 must be expressed in terms of @xmath257 . if @xmath147 is the number of acoustic periods measured at the observer location during @xmath256 then @xmath258 . \\n the time taken for the source to generate those @xmath147 periods is @xmath259 so @xmath260 . \\n finally , it is convenient to express @xmath257 in terms of the blade azimuthal angle @xmath261 using the relation @xmath262 . \\n the time averaged psd from a rotating blade element is hence given by    @xmath263    the above result agrees with  @xcite , provided that @xmath4 is replaced by @xmath264 in the left hand side of ( 54 ) in their report , and @xmath4 and @xmath264 are swapped in the left hand side of their equation ( 56 ) . \\n note that there has been some discrepancy in the literature about the exponent in the doppler term of  . \\n for example , @xcite initially proposed a value of 1 for the exponent . the same is considered by @xcite . \\n this ignores the additional weighting of the time increment and is equivalent to averaging over the angular position of a blade segment . \\n we propose that the correct value of the exponent is 2 . in section \\n [ sec : results ] , evidence for this is provided by comparison of predictions using the two methods presented in sections  [ cha : kim - george - approach ] to [ sec : amiets - appr - rotat ] . \\n in this section , both amiet s formulation ( equation  ) and our new formulation ( equation  ) are applied to several model blade elements . \\n these blade elements have been chosen to cover the range of applications featured in the literature on trailing edge noise : cooling fans  @xcite , open propellers  @xcite and wind turbines@xcite . \\n each blade element is described through its distance from the hub ( radius ) , its geometry ( chord and pitch angle @xmath45 ) , and the set of mach numbers ( blade mach @xmath265 , flow mach numbers relative to the observer @xmath266 and to the blade @xmath267 ) , whose values have been chosen to match a typical situation . \\n for example , a typical wind turbine element has a large chord , low pitch angle and rotates at low mach number in a low wind speed . \\n the specific values chosen here , presented in table  [ tab : params ] , were the ones used by @xcite . \\n the span is arbitrarily equal to the chord . \\n note that for each blade element , the values are not independent ; the three mach number form a velocity triangle wherein the pitch angle is between @xmath268 and @xmath269 . \\n furthermore , the values would usually change along a full blade . \\n .typical parameters for the blade segments used in three different applications : open - propeller , cooling fan and wind turbine . \\n these parameters are the ones proposed by  @xcite . \\n the span is defined as a third of the radius . \\n the wind mach numbers , relative to the observer @xmath270(@xmath271 ) or to the blade @xmath272(@xmath273 ) can be obtained from the pitch angle @xmath45 and blade speed @xmath265 but are given for completeness . [ cols=\\\"<,<,<,<\\\",options=\\\"header \\\" , ]     although this paper focuses on noise radiation from small blade elements , the noise spectrum of a full blade may be obtained using strip theory . in strip theory , \\n one divides the blade into small elements along its radius and sums the ( uncorrelated ) noise spectra generated from each element . \\n limitations and extensions of strip theory are discussed in  @xcite . \\n in addition to the approximations discussed in section  [ sec : trailing - edge - noise]([sec : discussion ] ) , the thin - blade approximation has been used . \\n this is not a good approximation for angles close to the propeller axis where a numerical approach taking the thickness of the blade into account may be preferable  @xcite . \\n figure  [ fig : exponents ] compares the sound pressure level directivity obtained using the new formulation and sclinker and amiet s approach , when the exponents of the doppler shift ( see equation  ) takes the values 1 , 2 and -2 taken from the literature . a low mach number case ( wind turbine ) \\n is shown in figure  [ fig : exponents](a ) , and a high mach number case ( open propeller ) in figure  [ fig : exponents](b ) . \\n differences of up to @xmath274 db and @xmath275 db can be seen when schlinker and amiet s approach are used with an exponent of @xmath276 ( square symbols ) and @xmath277 ( round symbols ) respectively . the best agreement between the new approach and schlinker and amiet s approach \\n is obtained for an exponent of @xmath278 ( @xmath279 symbols ) , which validates equation  . \\n figure  [ fig : results ] shows the sound pressure level directivity for the blade segments defined in table  [ tab : params ] that model a cooling fan ( figure [ fig:3 ] ) , a wind turbine ( figure [ fig:4 ] ) , and an open propeller at take - off ( figure [ fig:1 ] ) and cruise ( figure [ fig:2 ] ) . in each case , the results are obtained using the new formulation ( dashed line ) and amiet s approach ( solid line ) . in figures  [ fig : exponents ] and [ fig : results ] the levels are normalised to give an effective observer distance of @xmath280 and the observer is located at @xmath281 . \\n the two approaches agree to within 1  db in all cases . \\n these results suggest that schlinker and amiet s theory is valid when the acceleration effects are negligible , i.e. @xmath282 , and when amiet s blade response function is applicable , i.e. @xmath283 . since @xmath284 , this ratio is larger than @xmath285 for all the test cases in table [ tab : params ] . \\n note also that schlinker and amiet s formulation is applicable even for high speed open rotors : figure  [ fig:2 ] shows a good agreement for the open propeller model at cruise for which the chordwise mach number is very high ( @xmath286 ) . \\n schlinker and amiet s  ( @xcite ) theory of trailing noise from rotating blade has been validated by comparison with a new formulation that implicitly includes acceleration effects . \\n the results presented in this paper show that the modified form of schlinker and amiet s predicts sound pressure levels within 1  db of our new formulation for subsonic chordwise mach numbers of up to 0.95 at high frequencies ( @xmath283 and @xmath282 ) . \\n it is therefore applicable to both low speed applications ( cooling fans , wind turbines ) and high speed ones ( propellers ) . \\n we propose that the correct exponent for the doppler weighting @xmath287 in schlinker and amiet s theory is @xmath288 . \\n using @xmath289 , as in  @xcite and  @xcite gives results that agree with our formulation to within 5  db . \\n however , all other things being equal , putting @xmath290 in schlinker and amiet s theory overestimates the result by up to 20  db at high mach numbers . \\n the range of validity of amiet s theory for rotating blades is currently limited to high frequencies for two reasons : it uses a high frequency blade response function and neglects the effect of blade acceleration . \\n more research is needed to identify the most important effect between the two . \\n if the effect of acceleration can be neglected , i.e. at high frequency relative to the rotational speed , amiet s theory can be extended to lower frequencies by using a low frequency blade response function ( @xcite ) . \\n taking the fourier transform of over @xmath21 , and using the far field approximation of   yields @xmath291 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 . using the jacobi - anger expansion @xmath292 which yields equation  . \\n the doppler shift indicates how the frequency of a pure tone varies for a moving observer ( relative to the source ) , compared to a fixed observer . following  @xcite , \\n an alternative physical interpretation can be obtained by observing that , for a pure tone , the pressure @xmath294 for a fixed observer and @xmath78 for a moving observer are given by @xmath295 where @xmath3 is the source frequency and @xmath4 the frequency received by the moving observer . \\n the above equation implies that the measurement of the pressure time history is sped up ( or slowed down ) , by a factor @xmath296 , for a moving observer , compared to a fixed observer .      from equation  , the autocorrelations @xmath297 and @xmath298 for a fixed observer and a moving observer ( relative to the source ) , \\n are such that @xmath299 where @xmath300 . \\n since the power spectral density ( psd ) is defined as the fourier transform of the autocorrelation , the psd @xmath301 , for a moving observer , is related to the psd @xmath302 for a fixed observer by @xmath303 i.e.    @xmath304 \\n [ fig:1_egamma_ez ] [ fig:2_ex_ey ]    we derive the chordwise mach number @xmath167 given the blade mach number @xmath305 and the flow mach number @xmath209 . as illustrated in figure  [ fig : coordinates_isolated](b ) , @xmath209 can be decomposed into a component @xmath6 normal to the rotor plane ( inflow ) , and a component @xmath306 parallel to the rotor plane ( cross - flow ) : @xmath307 from figure  [ fig : coordinates_isolated](a ) , the chordwise mach number @xmath308 is given by @xmath309 from figure  [ fig : coordinates_isolated](b ) , the azimuthal mach number @xmath310 of the flow relative to the blade can be expressed in terms of @xmath265 and @xmath306 by @xmath311 substituting equation   into equation  , @xmath312 ^ 2 + m_z^2 } . \\\\ ] ]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"abstract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6436,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"we present an analysis of 4.5 years of high precision ( 0.1% ) space -

50 mmag in the v band . additionally , polaris is not even constant in its inconstancy , as both the pulsation period and the pulsation amplitude have changed in the past . \\n the amplitude in particular has changed substantially and is currently still changing , as we will describe in this paper . \\n polaris is an important star for a number of reasons \\n it is the nearest cepheid variable and a star where we can see stellar evolution taking place . \\n understanding the location of polaris on the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( and particularly the relationship of polaris to the instability strip ; whether it is a star undergoing its first or third or even fifth crossing ) and the nature of the pulsations ( whether fundamental model or an overtone pulsator ) are all important questions in stellar evolution . \\n the first evidence suggesting the variable nature of polaris was presented 150 years ago @xcite with strong confirmation , along with the correct period , being supplied by @xcite via radial velocity measurements . \\n photometric detection of the pulsations were presented several years afterwards @xcite . \\n a large number of observations have have been made in the intervening years , which have helped to build a picture of how the star has been evolving over the last century and a half . despite this \\n , there is still a great deal of interest in polaris due to the changes in the period and amplitude of the oscillations , as well as unusual events such as the change from a steady decline in amplitude to a very rapid decline from 0.1 mag to @xmath30.02 mag during the 1960 s . during this time \\n , the period also readjusted downwards . \\n the rate of period change is an important diagnostic tool for determining which crossing of the instability strip a cepheid is undergoing . \\n the recent analysis of the o - c residuals of polaris by @xcite has led to the suggestion that the period of polaris is currently increasing at a rate of 4.5 s yr@xmath1 . \\n this rate of period change is unusual for a cepheid with this period and adds to the confusion as to what stage of its evolution polaris is actually at . in the following sections we present new smei photometric observations of polaris , \\n discuss the amplitude changes that we observe during the course of the observations and also look at the o - c residuals and interpret these in the light of recent measurements of the period . \\n the new photometry we present was obtained using the smei instrument on board the usaf coriolis spacecraft , which was launched in january 2003 into an 840  km sun - synchronous polar orbit with an orbital period of 101 minutes . \\n smei consists of 3 cameras , each with a field of view of @xmath4 , which monitors nearly the entire sky over one orbit . \\n consequently , we obtain data for polaris on essentially every orbital pass . \\n smei has a roughly triangular pass band with a peak quantum efficiency of 47% at 700 nm and falling to 5% at 430 nm and 1025 nm . \\n although smei is a small instrument , the fact that it has monitored the entire sky with a cadence of @xmath5 minutes for over 4 years , results in stellar light curves , for bright stars , that are unprecedented . \\n an overview of the smei instrument can be found in @xcite , and an overview of stellar variability results being obtained with smei will be presented in @xcite . \\n smei results on the variability of the red giant arcturus can be found in @xcite . \\n the polaris data spans from april 2003 to october 2007 , with a 70% fill throughout this period of time , giving us an exceptional data sample to investigate the period and amplitude variations of the 3.97 day oscillations exhibited by polaris . \\n the full details of the reduction pipeline for generating time - series from the smei data will be presented in @xcite , so we only discuss the data reduction briefly here . \\n the raw images obtained by the smei instrument are bias subtracted , have a temperature scaled dark current signal removed , and are flat fielded . \\n hot pixels and high energy particle hits are corrected on the images via interpolation , before aperture photometry is performed . \\n the resulting light curves are corrected for systematic effects resulting from the variation of the psf as it moves across the ccd and vignetting / optical effects . removing a best fit sine curve from the entirety of the dataset highlighted non - regular systematic variations at the few mmag level which we have largely removed using a smoothed box car average obtained with a window width of @xmath312 days . \\n we finally removed a number of spurious data points from the data , which were primarily due to uncorrected cosmic rays , by performing a 3 sigma clip on short 28 day sections of data from which the best fitting sinusoidal relation for each section had been removed . \\n the resulting time series can be seen in fig . \\n [ timeseries ] along with a closer view of a section of data taken from 13th september 2006 to 29th november 2006 , which highlights the level of precision we are able to attain over a long baseline . \\n in order to study the amplitude of the 3.97 day ( 2.914@xmath6hz ) oscillation we have generated fourier spectra of both long ( 8 - 9 months ) and short ( 28 day ) sections of the time series data . \\n the resulting trend from computing the mean amplitude in each data chunk is shown in fig . \\n [ three_epoch ] and fig . \\n [ monthly_fft ] . to create the fourier spectra , we first subtracted a robust mean from the time series and the residuals were then converted to a change in magnitude relative to the mean magnitude . after computing the fourier spectra we ensured that in every case the power corresponding to the 3.97 day oscillation was restricted to a single bin , and padding the data with zeros to artificially enhance the resolution of the fourier spectra had no effect on the computed amplitudes . \\n = 5.8 cm    = 5.75 cm    fig . \\n [ three_epoch ] shows the 2.914 @xmath6hz peak in the fourier spectra for three @xmath39 month sections of the light curve . \\n the peaks for the 2003 and 2004 - 2005 data have been offset by @xmath70.8 and @xmath70.4 @xmath6hz respectively to highlight the increase in the amplitude over time . \\n on the assumption that polaris is oscillating in the first overtone mode ( see section 4 ) , we do not detect any significant power at the expected frequency for the fundamental mode , i.e. @xmath8hz . the trend of the increasing amplitude is highlighted more clearly in fig . \\n [ monthly_fft ] where we have plotted the mean amplitude calculated in consecutive 28 day chunks of data . \\n each 28 day section contained 400 data points after data gaps had been filled with zero values . \\n the best fitting linear relation describing the rate of increase for the peak to peak amplitude is @xmath9 mmag yr@xmath1 . \\n some of the scatter in the plot is attributed to the varying amplitude of the oscillations , which @xcite also saw in wire observations , and suggested it could be due to the analogue of the blazkho effect in cepheids . in our analysis , however , we do not see any significant periodic variations in the amplitude above a level of @xmath10  mmag appearing consistently throughout the observations . \\n this is to our knowledge the first highly confident detection of the amplitude increase over the last few years from photometric measurements , although some hint has been given previously @xcite . \\n this completely contradicts the claim that polaris is about to cease its variability and leave the instability strip @xcite , although this was based somewhat on an erroneous result . \\n .recent measurements of the period of polaris suggest that it has undergone another recent decline . \\n there seems to have been a large decline between 1988 and 1993 , with the rate slowing in the last ten years . in total , the period has reduced by around 200 seconds over the last 20 years.[periods ] [ cols=\\\"^ , < , < \\\" , ]     the o - c residuals obtained from @xcite , along with the new values calculated from our data are plotted in fig . \\n we have used the same time regimes as this paper ( i.e. pre-1963 and post 1965 ) to determine our rate of period change . the best fitting parabolic relation for observations before 1963 , as determined by @xcite , provides an estimate for the rate of period increase over this time of @xmath11 s yr@xmath1 the best fitting parabolic relation for the data since 1963 , with the inclusion of our new measurements suggests the mean rate of increase for the period has increased to @xmath2 s yr@xmath1 this relation is again shown in fig . \\n [ oc ] . ignoring the data from 1966 , as in @xcite , insignificantly alters the value to @xmath12 s yr@xmath1 . ignoring the datum from 1965 \\n , however , causes a dramatic change to the calculated value , giving instead @xmath13 s yr@xmath14 . \\n it is clear therefore that the mean rate of period increase over the last 50 years has been between 4.4 and 5 s yr@xmath1 , consistent with the rate before 1963 . \\n if one looks more closely at recent measurements for the period , however , it does appear that it may have recently undergone a rapid decline , similar to that seen in the early 1960 s . \\n table  [ periods ] shows the period as measured several times over the last 20 years with the values obtained from @xcite and references therein , together with the period measured from our new results . \\n the decline is very evident , and amounts to a decrease of around 200 seconds during the last 20 years , but the rate has been much slower over the last ten years than it was between 1987 and 1997 . additionally , although our results are fairly consistent with a period increase of 4.9  s  yr@xmath1 , they do follow a slightly shallower trend which is likely due to the recent decrease in period . \\n we will now discuss these results in the context of stellar evolution and ascertain what implications they have on the evolutionary stage of polaris . \\n there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that polaris is a first overtone ( s - cepheid ) oscillator . \\n @xcite used the hipparcos parallax ( measured to be @xmath15  mas for polaris ) to fit period - luminosity models to a sample of cepheids and concluded that the best fit for polaris resulted if it was treated as a first overtone pulsator . \\n the updated value for the hipparcos parallax of polaris is @xmath16  mas @xcite , therefore this conclusion is still valid . \\n @xcite used interferometry to measure the radius of polaris to be @xmath17 , and again this is only consistent with the pulsation period if polaris is a first overtone pulsator . \\n the mean rate of change of the period and the small amplitude of the oscillations are also indicators that polaris oscillates in an overtone mode . \\n combining this with the fact that polaris exhibits a highly symmetrical light curve , it exhibits all of the features we expect from s - cepheids . \\n = 5.8 cm    = 5.65 cm    @xcite suggest that polaris exists at the cool edge of the region of the instability strip occupied by the s - cepheids , but that the positive period change could not be due to evolution as the star would be evolving towards the centre of the instability strip , which would defy the previously declining amplitude . @xcite \\n also place polaris on the red edge of the instability strip for putative first crossers , which corresponds to the s - cepheid red edge in this case . \\n they do however suggest the possibility of polaris being a fundamental pulsator , which is unlikely given the evidence above . \\n @xcite on the other hand believed that polaris was about to evolve out of the instability strip completely , which would require it to be near the edge of the instability strip , which it certainly does not appear to be . \\n the behaviour we are now seeing from polaris is consistent with what we expect from a cepheid located in the instability strip where @xcite and @xcite suggest , but the conclusion that the period change is not due to evolution may be incorrect . \\n = 7.9 cm    firstly , consider the evidence that the period has once again undergone a rapid decline , which could be a phase of blueward evolution , as @xcite suggests could be the case for the 1963 - 66 period readjustment . \\n secondly , the amplitude appeared to cease its decline in the early 1990s , and is now seemingly increasing again . \\n one might expect to see such behaviour if polaris was undergoing an evolutionary change in its oscillation mode . \\n if we look at the models for s - cepheids produced by @xcite , and specifically look at the location of polaris in the computed instability regimes then , as fig . \\n [ ismodel ] shows , polaris lies on the red edge of the overtone instability strip for their non - linear convective model , which is able to generate light and radial velocity curves very similar to those found observationally . if the true red edge of the first overtone instability strip lies close to the one computed in this fbk model , then polaris is in fact undergoing a change from being a first overtone pulsator ( assuming it is evolving to the cooler side of the instability strip ) to becoming either a fundamental pulsator or a double mode pulsator . \\n the position of polaris in fig . \\n [ ismodel ] suggests that its mass is not quite great enough to enter the fundamental pulsator regime , which occurs for masses greater than around @xmath18 ( the knee in the model track ) , but recent measurements by @xcite for example , do not place enough of a constraint on the mass to make an absolute determination as to which regime polaris will enter . \\n if polaris is about to cross into another pulsation regime , then we might expect to see occasional blips in the period as this readjustment phase takes place . \\n finally , the crossing mode of polaris is also uncertain . \\n @xcite suggest that despite polaris exhibiting a deficiency of carbon and an over - abundance of nitrogen @xcite , this can not be interpreted in any fashion to determine the crossing mode , such as was done by @xcite . \\n somewhat controversially , @xcite suggests that polaris has a small over - abundance of carbon , which would certainly place it in a first crossing scenario . \\n the rate of period change for cepheids is an indicator of the crossing mode @xcite . \\n if we assume polaris to be oscillating in the first overtone mode , and take the rate of period change over the last 150 years to be + 4.5 s yr@xmath1 , then this is a factor of @xmath33 too small for a first crossing cepheid and about the same factor too large for a third crossing cepheid . \\n @xcite suggest that the observable characteristics of polaris are most consistent with a first time crosser . \\n interestingly , however , if one only considers the trend in the period from the last 20 years , then we see a decline at a rate of @xmath19 s yr@xmath1 . \\n this is actually consistent with a first overtone cepheid undergoing its second crossing . \\n the possibility that polaris is in its second crossing was also discussed by @xcite . \\n we must be cautious , however , as the rate over the last fourteen years , using measurements with much better precision than those presented in @xcite , only suggest a decline of @xmath20 s yr@xmath1 . \\n clearly , it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions on the crossing mode at present . \\n the new results obtained with smei strongly suggest the amplitude of polaris is once again increasing \\n . the star does seem to be oscillating in the first overtone mode , but likely lies close to the red edge of the instability strip for s - cepheids , and is therefore likely to soon evolve into either a fundamental or double - mode pulsation cepheid , assuming the cepheid is undergoing its first or third crossing . \\n it is uncertain how quickly polaris will evolve across the boundary between pulsation regimes and what behaviour the cepheid will exhibit as it does so . \\n one slight oddity in the results is the lack of evidence for the fundamental mode of oscillation being present , but this may appear in the near future . \\n it is therefore crucial that high precision monitoring of this star is continued for the foreseeable future so that the changes can be watched closely . \\n we would like to thank the referee , clifton laney , for his extremely useful comments , which have helped improve this paper . \\n sas acknowledges support from stfc and the school of physics and astronomy , university of birmingham . \\n smei was designed and built by members of ucsd , afrl , and the university of birmingham . \\n we particularly thank yvonne elsworth , andrew buffington , chris eyles and james tappin .\",\n          \"in the presence of noise and perturbations , the information stored in quantum systems is typically lost . indeed , orthogonal states ( or their superpositions ) \\n may evolve into similar states , so that even when the perturbation is known it is impossible to restore the original one . \\n @xcite however , the rate at which information corrupts depends on how it is actually encoded , on the nature of the perturbations , as well as on the properties of the system . in particular , in the case of a many - body system , this rate may depend on its size : for the larger hilbert space there is `` more space '' to keep the states distinguishable . \\n systems possessing this property for naturally occurring perturbations may serve as quantum memories ,  @xcite which can reliably store quantum states for long times .    in this article \\n , we investigate the capability of a kitaev chain  @xcite to store quantum states in the presence of noise . \\n we consider the encoding of a qubit in the zero - energy majorana modes of a kitaev chain described by hamiltonian @xmath0 and analyze the loss of information occurring when the time evolution describing the storage period is dictated by a different hamiltonian , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is an unknown perturbation . \\n we explicitly focus on time - dependent quadratic perturbations containing high frequencies and find that the quantum memory can be robust to a wide range of perturbations . \\n specifically , even though perturbations spread the qubit in the whole hilbert space and the average over several @xmath3 is considered , the orthogonality of any pair of initial states is preserved for very long times : the rate at which the information is lost decreases exponentially with the system size . \\n the potential use as quantum memories of kitaev chains  @xcite and of other topological systems  @xcite has been extensively studied in recent years , following the seminal work by kitaev . \\n @xcite most of the prior work has focused on analyzing systems with topological order , whereby the degeneracy of the ground state subspace is stable under small local perturbations  @xcite with frequencies well below the characteristic energy gap . \\n this ensures that all of the ground states of the perturbed hamiltonian have a trivial evolution so that , when encoded in these ground states , the information can survive for long times . \\n in contrast , here we consider the situation when highly excited states are created due to sudden quench perturbations with high - frequency excitations above the gap . \\n @xcite in such cases , conventional topological protection is no longer effective . \\n @xcite    our work is closely connected to the use of topological systems as error correcting codes in the context of self - protected quantum memories . \\n @xcite however , in contrast to previous investigations , we do not consider a specific error correction procedure ,  @xcite but rather analyze whether the information is still present `` somewhere '' in the hilbert space . \\n in fact , our analysis shows that the memory time grows exponentially with the system size in situations where previous approaches give a negative result . \\n besides , our results may bear an interesting connection to the phenomenon of many - body localization  @xcite , whereby different initial states remain distinguishable for arbitrarily long times under a quench .    in this article \\n we introduce a series of theoretical tools to analyze the loss of quantum information encoded in many - body systems and characterize the optimal procedure to decode it . in a quantum - memory framework , we quantify the amount of information that may be recovered after the storage period and evaluate it , as well as its upper and lower bounds , for different relevant cases . for the problem of interest \\n , our numerical methods can investigate relatively large systems , and the appropriate size - scalings are derived . \\n we identify the conditions for a memory time that scales exponentially with the system size and study how this exponential dependence is affected by finite temperatures , or by the particle exchange between the chain and a reservoir . \\n this article is organized as follows . in sec . \\n [ sec : setup ] we review the theory of a quantum memory based on the majorana modes of two kitaev chains , and set up the notation . in sec . \\n [ sec : rec : of : info ] we present the theory of the optimal recoverability of the information , both for general and for gaussian recovery operations . in sec . \\n [ sec : result ] we present the main result of the article , namely the fact that a quantum memory based on the kitaev chain can withstand a sudden quench perturbation . in sec . \\n [ sec : discussion ] we further elaborate on it , and the effect of temperature and particle losses is considered . finally , in sec .  [ sec : conc ] we present our conclusions . \\n we consider a kitaev chain of @xmath4 majorana ( real ) modes , @xmath5 , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 . \\n the hamiltonian is :  @xcite @xmath8 at zero temperature , it has a topological phase for @xmath9 and the ground state is quasi - degenerate due to the existence of ( nearly ) zero energy majorana modes , @xmath10 , localized at the edges . \\n they can be expressed as linear combinations of the @xmath11 , and can be used to define a dirac mode @xmath12 . due to superselection rules on the parity of the number of fermions , two such dirac modes \\n are necessary in order to define a meaningful qubit . \\n thus , we consider a second kitaev chain , whose zero - energy majorana modes are @xmath13 , and which define a dirac mode @xmath14 . \\n we define a qubit in the even parity sector of the model : @xmath15 and construct a set of pauli operators : @xmath16 results would be identical , apart from notation , in the odd sector : @xmath17 . \\n is encoded into a topological system of size @xmath18 and stored for a time @xmath19 . \\n perturbations act on the system during the storage and induce a non - unitary time - evolution that destroys the encoded information . \\n we model this process with a decoherence channel @xmath20 . \\n a recovery operation attempts at retrieving the information and reconstructs a qubit @xmath21 which should be as similar as possible to @xmath22 . ]    when the hamiltonian is perturbed or there is an interaction with the environment , the chain undergoes a non - trivial dynamics . \\n let us denote by @xmath23 the _ decoherence channel _ that describes the encoding of a qubit into the ground state of the chains and the subsequent time - evolution which describes the storage of the information ( see fig . \\n [ fig : sketch ] ) . \\n note that the latter takes into account both the hamiltonian part of the time evolution and the non - unitary action of perturbations . \\n the decoherence channel maps the state of the qubit onto the state of the two chains ; therefore , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a qubit density operator and @xmath26 is the state of the chains at time @xmath19 . \\n @xmath27 thus represents the many - body state where the information is encoded and it must always fulfill @xmath28 , where @xmath29 are the usual pauli matrices and the @xmath30 are defined in  . these conditions do not define @xmath27 uniquely ; where not explicitly stated , we will consider : @xmath31 where operators @xmath32 diagonalize the total hamiltonian and @xmath33 labels those modes which have non - zero energy ; @xmath34 is a properly chosen constant .    in order to simplify the discussion , we assume that the chains are kept far apart , so that they do not interact with each other or with the same environment . \\n moreover , throughout the article we assume that the first dirac mode , @xmath35 , does not undergo any dynamics , neither hamiltonian nor dissipative , as in general only the relative time evolution of the two chains contributes to the corruption of the information . in this setting \\n there is no need to keep track of the modes of the first chain different from @xmath35 . \\n after the storage time @xmath19 , the attempt to retrieve the initial qubit is described by the _ recovery channel _ , @xmath36 , which maps back the chain and the extra fermionic mode , @xmath35 , to a qubit ( see fig .  [ \\n fig : sketch ] ) . \\n it has to be chosen such that the composite channel @xmath37 is as close as possible to the identity channel . \\n this can be quantified with the _ recovery fidelity _ :  @xcite @xmath38 where the integral is over the surface of the bloch sphere .    in appendix  [ appendix1 ] \\n we demonstrate that , given a decoherence channel , the optimal fidelity @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 are the ( pure ) eigenstates of @xmath43 with eigenvalues @xmath44 , and @xmath45 denotes the trace norm , i.e. the sum of the singular values of the operator . \\n .   shows that @xmath39 depends on the distance @xmath46 between two many - body states which result from the time evolution of two orthogonal qubit states . at @xmath47 , @xmath48 but it decreases with time due to noise and perturbations , and no physical operation can increase it again because of the contractivity of the trace norm . \\n @xcite    in appendix  [ appendix1 ] we also characterize the properties of the _ optimal recovery operation _ @xmath49 that saturates the bound @xmath50 of eq .  . \\n this @xmath49 consists in the measurement on @xmath51 of three many - body observables @xmath52 , that ( i ) essentially undo the rotation that the axes of the original qubit @xmath53 have undergone , and ( ii ) quantify the distance between pairs of initially orthogonal states aligned on them . \\n indeed , they are chosen so that @xmath54   \\\\doteqdot \\\\| \\\\mathcal d_t ( \\\\hat \\\\sigma_\\\\alpha)\\\\|_{\\\\text{tr}}= 2 d ( \\\\hat \\\\rho_{\\\\alpha,+}(t ) , \\\\hat \\\\rho_{\\\\alpha,-}(t ) ) $ ] , where we applied the linearity of @xmath55 on the eigenstates @xmath56 of @xmath57 : @xmath58 + \\\\frac{1}{2 } \\\\sum_\\\\alpha \\\\hat \\\\sigma_\\\\alpha \\\\,{\\\\text{tr}}\\\\left[\\\\hat h_\\\\alpha\\\\hat \\\\rho ( t ) \\\\right].\\\\ ] ] alternatively , the optimal recovery operation can be thought of as a two - step procedure : the first being a unitary acting over the global hilbert space that attempts to align back the image of the bloch sphere , and the second a trace on all the fermionic modes different from @xmath35 and @xmath59 , where the initial qubit was defined and the recovered one is recreated . notice that the unitary ( defined in terms of @xmath52 s ) may involve @xmath18-body terms acting on all the fermionic modes of the chain and the specific form depends on the singular value decomposition of @xmath60 .    because the optimal recovery operation can be difficult to implement in practice , it is natural to restrict the optimization of @xmath61 to those physical actions that can be operatively realized . \\n those actions depend on the specific experimental setup and should be independently studied for each physical implementation . here \\n we consider as experimentally - relevant recovery operations those which are fermionic gaussian channels . \\n @xcite they comprise the addition and discard of auxiliary modes , the time evolution under quadratic hamiltonians and under master equations with linear jump operators ( see appendix  [ sec : fgstates ] for a short introduction ) . in appendix  [ appendix2 ] \\n we show that the best recovery fidelity attainable with a fermionic gaussian channel is : @xmath62 here , @xmath63 are the covariance matrices ( cm ) of @xmath64 , defined as @xmath65_{j , k } \\\\doteqdot i \\\\text{tr } [ \\\\hat \\\\rho_\\\\pm ( t ) \\\\hat c_j \\\\hat c_k]$ ] . \\n the @xmath66 denotes the operator norm , i.e. the largest singular value of the operator . \\n similarly to the previous case , it is possible to characterize the properties of the _ optimal gaussian recovery operation _ that achieves @xmath67 ( see appendix  [ appendix2 ] ) . \\n , @xmath68 and : ( a , c ) @xmath69 , @xmath70 ;

plotted values for @xmath145 are obtained via scaling as @xmath146 ( see appendix  [ app : ham : pert ] ) . ]      from the previous discussion , it may appear that the exact distribution of the parameters corresponding to the possible perturbations is necessary in order to implement the `` correct '' best recovery operation , as formulated in eq .  . \\n interestingly , instead , we can show that only a coarse knowledge of the interval @xmath147 of possible values is sufficient , as long as it includes the real one @xmath148 , to obtain a recovery whose quality ( in terms of fidelity or storage time ) increments exponentially with the size @xmath18 of the physical system .    for the sake of simplicity \\n , we consider the case where only one parameter ( e.g. , the chemical potential @xmath121 ) varies according to box distributions in @xmath147 and @xmath149 , but generalizations on both hypothesis would be straightforward . \\n let us call @xmath150 and @xmath151 the decoherence channels associated with the noise model as in eq .  , @xmath152 and @xmath153 their outcomes descending from the pure state input @xmath22 , and @xmath154 the absolute best recovery operation for @xmath155 computed by making use of eq .  . \\n by definition , we know that @xmath156 , with @xmath157 scaling exponentially with the size @xmath18 . in appendix  [ app : prior ] we show that @xmath158 , where @xmath159 , a bound that also scales exponentially with the size @xmath18 . \\n thus , the application of @xmath154 after the action of @xmath160 defines a memory time that , though not absolute best , still increases exponentially with the size of the system . \\n it is therefore demonstrated that one does not need a fine - tuned knowledge of the perturbation ( and therefore of the absolute optimal @xmath161 ) in order to gain exponential protection of the qubit storage . \\n so far , we considered only perturbations preserving the quadratic character of the hamiltonian \\n . it would be interesting to analyze whether the exponential scaling persists even in the presence of more general perturbations , and in particular of interactions . \\n although such a study is outside the scope of the present work because it requires the use of different numerical techniques , we believe that interactions may not lead to a dramatic change of the picture arising from the previous discussion . \\n indeed , time evolution in presence of interactions can be considered within the generalized bogoliubov theory . \\n @xcite the result is a non - linear problem that can be mapped onto a quadratic time - dependent hamiltonian whose coefficients depend on the state which is evolved in time . remarkably , such time - dependent hamiltonian has the form of those investigated above , so that we still expect the memory time to increase with the system size .     and the figure shows the upper bound as a function of time for different lengths of the chain @xmath162 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 . \\n ( right ) size is fixed : @xmath163 and the figure shows the upper bound as a function of time for different temperatures @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 . \\n we take @xmath169 realizations . ] \\n we next examine memory performance for the restricted set of gaussian recovery operations . \\n [ fig : gaussianrecovery ] displays the optimal gaussian fidelity in the presence of the same perturbations as in fig . \\n [ fig : decomap : unknownham](a ) : the fidelity improves with the size of the system but saturates for sufficiently large @xmath18 . \\n remarkably , similar results are obtained when the encoding is performed in the state of the second chain where all of the non - zero modes are initially in thermal equilibrium at a temperature @xmath170 : @xmath171}.\\\\ ] ] operators @xmath172 diagonalize @xmath0 and @xmath173 is the corresponding energy ; @xmath174 and @xmath175 .    because we deal with convex combinations of mixed states \\n , we can only plot an upper bound @xmath176 to the optimal fidelity  ( see appendix  [ app : ham : pert ] ) , which we observed to be very close to the exact value in cases in which the latter was computable ( not shown ) . for temperatures above the gap , fig . \\n [ fig : decomap : temperature ]  ( left ) displays a clear saturation behavior . for temperatures below the gap , our results are not conclusive ( not shown ) , even if lowering the temperature keeping a fixed value of @xmath18 clearly increases the saturation bound , as shown in fig . \\n [ fig : decomap : temperature ]  ( right ) . \\n thus , it appears that the temperature defines an effective system size up to which topological protection can occur . \\n these results can be understood as follows : ( i ) although each term in the integral   is gaussian , its sum ( convex combination ) is not , and thus the density operator is not gaussian either ; ( ii ) a gaussian recovery operation can only depend on the cm of the states @xmath177 , which for ( pure ) non - gaussian states coincides with that of a mixed gaussian state . \\n @xcite thus , restricting to gaussian recoveries has the same effect as considering mixed states , and this explains the similarity between this case and that of finite temperature . \\n finally , we consider the effect of particle interchange with the environment . \\n previous works already indicate that a quantum memory may be extremely sensitive to any such perturbation . \\n @xcite we find that this remains the case even when the optimal recovery is used . \\n to show this , we describe the interaction of the system with a bath with which it can interchange particles via a lindblad master equation : @xmath178 + \\\\gamma \\\\sum_{n=1}^n \\\\left ( \\\\hat d_{n } \\\\ , \\\\hat{\\\\rho } \\\\ , \\\\hat d_{n}^{\\\\dagger } - \\\\frac 12 \\\\ { \\\\hat d_{n}^{\\\\dagger } \\\\hat d_n   , \\\\hat{\\\\rho } \\\\}_+ \\n \\\\label{eq : master : equation}\\\\ ] ] here @xmath179 annihilates one fermion in the @xmath180-th physical site , and @xmath0 is the protecting hamiltonian . \\n this equation transforms gaussian states into gaussian states , and thus can be rewritten in terms of the cm . \\n @xcite the optimal fidelity   can not be directly computed in terms of the cm . in order to circumvent this problem , we bound @xmath122 with @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is the uhlmann fidelity ,  @xcite which for gaussian states is a function of their cm ( see appendix  [ sec : fgstates ] ) . \\n results in fig .  [ \\n fig : poisoning ] demonstrate that the information is corrupted at a rate which does not depend on the system size , the reason being the uniqueness of the fixed point of  , reached in a time independent of the size .     and @xmath183 . \\n ( left ) upper and lower bound to the optimal fidelity as a function of time , showing a clear exponential scaling . \\n ( right ) upper bound to the optimal fidelity as a function of time for different system sizes : @xmath184 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 . \\n results coincide exactly and are indistinguishable . ] \\n our work demonstrates that quantum information stored in kitaev s chain can be robust to perturbations if the optimal recovery of information is used . \\n we show that for a broad range of both quenching and time - dependent perturbations the memory time scales exponentially with the system size , and we have identified the condition   which is responsible for this result . \\n this effect disappears at sufficiently large temperatures , as well as when the system interchanges particles with a bath . \\n our results open a number of interesting research directions . \\n first , it would be interesting to explore in detail the stability of the memory when interactions are included . \\n this question could be answered for relatively small chains with an exact numerical calculations . because the study of large systems and long times may be beyond current numerical possibilities \\n , an experimental quantum simulation might be required . \\n second , the relation of the present observations to the topological properties of the kitaev chain has to be explored . \\n moreover , similar effects may be investigated in other topological models , as for example the @xmath185 model ,  @xcite where the methods developed here can be directly applied . \\n third , the implementation of the optimal recovery operation should be also analyzed , because the required recovery time required may need to grow exponentially with the system size . \\n finally , similar effects can be explored in other systems where the localization of information in hilbert space is resilient to temperature and general interactions with the environment . \\n specifically , it is intriguing to investigate the connection between our results and many - body localization phenomena . \\n @xcite some of the concepts and tools developed in the present work can be used to explore the utility of such systems for storage and manipulation of quantum information . \\n @xcite    we gratefully acknowledge fruitful discussions with g. giedke , v. giovannetti , b. horstmann , r. huse , c. kraus , f. pastawski . \\n special thanks for invaluable support to h .- h . \\n part of this work has been supported by the european community s seventh framework programme ( fp7/2007 - 2013 ) under grant agreement no . \\n 247687 ( ip - aqute ) . \\n lm is supported by regione toscana por fse 2007 - 2013 . \\n we present the derivation of eq .  . \\n we first show that the fidelity of any recovery operation is upper bounded by  , @xmath186 @xmath187 , and then construct an explicit recovery operation , @xmath188 , which achieves the upper bound . \\n we recall that for any bounded hermitian operator @xmath189 the trace norm is @xmath190 , and the maximization is restricted to hermitian operators fulfilling @xmath191 where @xmath192 denotes the maximum singular value of @xmath189 . \\n moreover , according to  , @xmath193 is an average over the bloch surface , which is best expressed as :  @xcite @xmath194.\\\\ ] ]    we derive the upper bound . because of the contractivity of the trace distance  @xcite under @xmath195 , the inequality @xmath196\\\\le \\n \\\\|\\\\hat \\\\sigma_\\\\alpha\\\\|_{\\\\rm op } \\\\|{\\\\cal t}_t(\\\\hat \\\\sigma_\\\\alpha)\\\\|_{\\\\text{tr}}\\\\le 1 \\\\cdot \\\\|{\\\\cal d}_t(\\\\hat \\\\sigma_\\\\alpha)\\\\|_{\\\\text{tr}}\\\\ ] ] holds , from which we obtain : @xmath197 where @xmath198 , with @xmath199 , @xmath200 . \\n notice that the states @xmath201 defined in sec . \\n [ sec : rec : of : info ] equal the @xmath202 which have been just defined . \\n let us now specify   to the case of @xmath23 not acting on the fermionic mode @xmath35 ( see sec . \\n [ sec : setup ] ) . \\n the operator @xmath203 is hermitian and @xmath204 ;

the proof is similar to that in appendix  [ appendix1 ] . \\n because gaussian fermionic channels map fermions to fermions , we need to explicitly consider the fact that the recovered qubit is composed of fermions . \\n in particular , we have to consider what happens when the decoherence channel changes the parity of the state but still preserves the orthogonality of the initial qubit states . \\n this may occur , for instance , when decoherence is caused by the coherent interchange of particles with a reservoir . \\n imagine the initial qubit state @xmath238 , @xmath239 , is mapped to ( see definitions in sec . \\n [ sec : setup ] ) : @xmath240 , which is a gaussian state . the problem can be bypassed defining the recovered ( fermionic ) qubit in both parity sectors . \\n recalling that @xmath241 , @xmath242 are the decoherence - free modes which constitute @xmath35 and that the zero - energy modes of the second kitaev chain are @xmath243 and @xmath244 ( see sec . \\n [ sec : setup ] ) , we express the pauli operators of the qubit as : @xmath245 where the modes @xmath246 and @xmath247 have been defined in sec . \\n [ sec : setup ] . \\n notice the difference with the @xmath248 in eq . \\n : the @xmath249 act on both the parity sectors of the qubit . \\n we recall that the action of a general gaussian channel transforms a gaussian @xmath250-modes state with cm : @xmath251 into a @xmath18-modes state with cm : @xmath252 ( see appendix  [ sec : fgstates ] and ref .

pressure spectrum should be measured experimentally . \\n this section is a detailed and corrected derivation of the theory presented by  @xcite . in particular , \\n the derivation of the present source position is both simpler and more general . \\n this section explains how to apply a theory derived in the wind tunnel reference frame , where a stationary source and observer are immersed in a uniform flow ( see section  [ sec : trailing - edge - noise ] ) , to the general case , where both the source and the fluid are moving relative to the observer . \\n @xcite observed that the sound emitted by a rotating blade is approximately equal to that emitted by a translating blade at the same location . \\n his observation was based on the expression of  @xcite for the pressure radiating from a rotating dipole : the difference between a rotating blade and a translating blade lies in the acceleration of the source in the direction of the observer . \\n amiet argued that when the angular velocity @xmath206 is much larger than the source frequency @xmath3 , the acceleration term becomes negligible . \\n this high frequency assumption will be validated in section  [ sec : results ] against the new formulation of section  [ cha : kim - george - approach ] . in the following \\n , we will assume that the blade is in rectilinear motion . \\n in the situation we are considering here , the observer is stationary relative to the hub and the blade moves through the fluid ( figure  [ fig : rotor_reference_frame ] ) . \\n however the formulae of section  [ sec : trailing - edge - noise ] , for a blade in a uniform flow , assume that the observer is stationary relative to the blade . \\n we therefore examine the current problem successively in these two reference frames . in the reference frame of the observer ( @xmath207 ) , \\n the observer is stationary and the blade moves rectilinearly at mach @xmath208 in a uniform flow of mach @xmath209 . \\n consider a pulse of sound emitted at @xmath8 from the blade . \\n when this pulse is received at the observer position @xmath20 , the blade has moved to the present source position @xmath210 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : reference_frames](a ) .     +   +    in the reference frame of the blade ( @xmath211 ) , the blade is stationary and the source is fixed to the present source position ( @xmath212 ) . \\n the mach number of the flow is @xmath213 and the observer is moving at mach  @xmath214 ( figure  [ fig : reference_frames](b ) ) . comparing figure  [ fig : reference_frames](b ) with figure  [ fig : isolated_aerofoil_frame ] , \\n this situation is equivalent to that of an isolated aerofoil in a uniform flow provided that the observer is stationary , i.e. @xmath215 . here \\n , the observer is moving relative to the blade which leads to a doppler shift whose impact on the instantaneous psd will be discussed later . \\n the above analysis indicates the steps required to apply the formulae derived for an aerofoil in a uniform flow to the present problem :    * move the origin of the coordinate system from @xmath8 to the present source position @xmath210 ; * rotate the axes of the coordinate system if necessary ; * account for the movement of the observer relative to the blade ( doppler shift ) .      from figure \\n [ fig : reference_frames](a ) , @xmath216 where @xmath217 denotes the propagation time . \\n the above result is more general than the equation ( 46 ) in  @xcite that is valid only if the chordwise mach number of the flow equals @xmath218 , i.e. if the angle of attack equals zero . \\n the source position at emission time satisfies @xmath219 , where @xmath220 is the blade tip radius , while @xmath221 for propagation to the far - field , therefore ( provided  @xmath222 ) @xmath223 for an observer in the far field , we can hence assume @xmath224 so that the source is located at the hub . \\n as demonstrated in the following , the propagation time @xmath217 is related to the convected source position @xmath225 . \\n the convected source position is defined as the emission position @xmath226 in the reference frame of the fluid ( figure  [ fig : reference_frames](c ) ) . in that reference frame , the fluid is stationary so the wavefronts are spherical and acoustic waves are propagating at the speed of sound . \\n this allows us to relate the propagation time @xmath217 to @xmath20 and @xmath225 since @xmath227 where we have used the fact that @xmath228 is independent of the reference frame ( see figure  [ fig : reference_frames ] ) .    in general the convected source position @xmath225 \\n is obtained by seeding the flow with a small particle that is released from the source position at emission time and convects at the mach number of the ambient fluid ; @xmath225 corresponds to the position of the particle at reception time . using the reference frame of the observer ( figure  [ fig : reference_frames](a ) ) , we get @xmath229    substituting   into   and taking the square of the result , @xmath230 the above equation leads to a second order polynomial equation in @xmath231 whose solution is given by @xmath232 where @xmath233 denotes the angle between @xmath209 and @xmath20 .      in the reference frame of the blade used in section  [ sec : trailing - edge - noise ] , the @xmath234-axis is pointing spanwise and the @xmath235-axis is pointing chordwise . \\n let @xmath236 denote the coordinate system centred on the present source position ( @xmath237 ) . \\n for the @xmath234-axis to point in the spanwise direction , the @xmath238-coordinate system is rotated by @xmath239 around the @xmath240-axis ( figure [ fig : x1_to_x2](a ) ) , i.e. @xmath241 where @xmath242 denotes the rotation matrix about the @xmath240-axis ( see equation  ) . \\n similarly , for the @xmath235-axis to point in the chordwise direction , the @xmath243-coordinate system is rotated by @xmath45 around the @xmath244-axis ( figure [ fig : x1_to_x2](b ) ) : @xmath245 where @xmath246 denotes the rotation matrix about the @xmath244-axis ( see equation  ) .    the transform from the observer reference frame ( figure  [ fig : reference_frames](a ) ) to the blade reference frame \\n is hence given by @xmath247      the sound frequency @xmath4 at the observer is shifted compared to the emission frequency @xmath3 . \\n the ratio @xmath248 is called the doppler shift and is a function of the source mach number @xmath208 and the flow mach number @xmath209 . as explained by  @xcite \\n , the doppler shift is given by @xmath249 where @xmath250 is the unit vector from the convected source position ( @xmath225 in figure  [ fig : reference_frames ] ) to the observer position . \\n [ sec : power - spectr - dens ]    it can be shown ( @xcite and appendix  [ sec : inst - freq - doppl ] ) that in the far field the psd for a moving observer , @xmath251 , is related to the psd for a fixed observer , @xmath252 by @xmath253 , therefore @xmath254 where @xmath252 can be estimated using the isolated aerofoil expression of  . furthermore , equation   is expressed in terms of the chordwise mach number @xmath255 of the flow relative to the blade . \\n a derivation of @xmath167 , extending that of  @xcite to the case of a non - zero angle of attack , is given in appendix  [ sec : chordw - mach - numb ] . \\n the time averaged psd is obtained by averaging the instantaneous psd , i.e. equation  , over one rotation of the rotor . since the instantaneous psd is a function of source time @xmath22 , the time increment @xmath256 must be expressed in terms of @xmath257 . if @xmath147 is the number of acoustic periods measured at the observer location during @xmath256 then @xmath258 . \\n the time taken for the source to generate those @xmath147 periods is @xmath259 so @xmath260 . \\n finally , it is convenient to express @xmath257 in terms of the blade azimuthal angle @xmath261 using the relation @xmath262 . \\n the time averaged psd from a rotating blade element is hence given by    @xmath263    the above result agrees with  @xcite , provided that @xmath4 is replaced by @xmath264 in the left hand side of ( 54 ) in their report , and @xmath4 and @xmath264 are swapped in the left hand side of their equation ( 56 ) . \\n note that there has been some discrepancy in the literature about the exponent in the doppler term of  . \\n for example , @xcite initially proposed a value of 1 for the exponent . the same is considered by @xcite . \\n this ignores the additional weighting of the time increment and is equivalent to averaging over the angular position of a blade segment . \\n we propose that the correct value of the exponent is 2 . in section \\n [ sec : results ] , evidence for this is provided by comparison of predictions using the two methods presented in sections  [ cha : kim - george - approach ] to [ sec : amiets - appr - rotat ] . \\n in this section , both amiet s formulation ( equation  ) and our new formulation ( equation  ) are applied to several model blade elements . \\n these blade elements have been chosen to cover the range of applications featured in the literature on trailing edge noise : cooling fans  @xcite , open propellers  @xcite and wind turbines@xcite . \\n each blade element is described through its distance from the hub ( radius ) , its geometry ( chord and pitch angle @xmath45 ) , and the set of mach numbers ( blade mach @xmath265 , flow mach numbers relative to the observer @xmath266 and to the blade @xmath267 ) , whose values have been chosen to match a typical situation . \\n for example , a typical wind turbine element has a large chord , low pitch angle and rotates at low mach number in a low wind speed . \\n the specific values chosen here , presented in table  [ tab : params ] , were the ones used by @xcite . \\n the span is arbitrarily equal to the chord . \\n note that for each blade element , the values are not independent ; the three mach number form a velocity triangle wherein the pitch angle is between @xmath268 and @xmath269 . \\n furthermore , the values would usually change along a full blade . \\n .typical parameters for the blade segments used in three different applications : open - propeller , cooling fan and wind turbine . \\n these parameters are the ones proposed by  @xcite . \\n the span is defined as a third of the radius . \\n the wind mach numbers , relative to the observer @xmath270(@xmath271 ) or to the blade @xmath272(@xmath273 ) can be obtained from the pitch angle @xmath45 and blade speed @xmath265 but are given for completeness . [ cols=\\\"<,<,<,<\\\",options=\\\"header \\\" , ]     although this paper focuses on noise radiation from small blade elements , the noise spectrum of a full blade may be obtained using strip theory . in strip theory , \\n one divides the blade into small elements along its radius and sums the ( uncorrelated ) noise spectra generated from each element . \\n limitations and extensions of strip theory are discussed in  @xcite . \\n in addition to the approximations discussed in section  [ sec : trailing - edge - noise]([sec : discussion ] ) , the thin - blade approximation has been used . \\n this is not a good approximation for angles close to the propeller axis where a numerical approach taking the thickness of the blade into account may be preferable  @xcite . \\n figure  [ fig : exponents ] compares the sound pressure level directivity obtained using the new formulation and sclinker and amiet s approach , when the exponents of the doppler shift ( see equation  ) takes the values 1 , 2 and -2 taken from the literature . a low mach number case ( wind turbine ) \\n is shown in figure  [ fig : exponents](a ) , and a high mach number case ( open propeller ) in figure  [ fig : exponents](b ) . \\n differences of up to @xmath274 db and @xmath275 db can be seen when schlinker and amiet s approach are used with an exponent of @xmath276 ( square symbols ) and @xmath277 ( round symbols ) respectively . the best agreement between the new approach and schlinker and amiet s approach \\n is obtained for an exponent of @xmath278 ( @xmath279 symbols ) , which validates equation  . \\n figure  [ fig : results ] shows the sound pressure level directivity for the blade segments defined in table  [ tab : params ] that model a cooling fan ( figure [ fig:3 ] ) , a wind turbine ( figure [ fig:4 ] ) , and an open propeller at take - off ( figure [ fig:1 ] ) and cruise ( figure [ fig:2 ] ) . in each case , the results are obtained using the new formulation ( dashed line ) and amiet s approach ( solid line ) . in figures  [ fig : exponents ] and [ fig : results ] the levels are normalised to give an effective observer distance of @xmath280 and the observer is located at @xmath281 . \\n the two approaches agree to within 1  db in all cases . \\n these results suggest that schlinker and amiet s theory is valid when the acceleration effects are negligible , i.e. @xmath282 , and when amiet s blade response function is applicable , i.e. @xmath283 . since @xmath284 , this ratio is larger than @xmath285 for all the test cases in table [ tab : params ] . \\n note also that schlinker and amiet s formulation is applicable even for high speed open rotors : figure  [ fig:2 ] shows a good agreement for the open propeller model at cruise for which the chordwise mach number is very high ( @xmath286 ) . \\n schlinker and amiet s  ( @xcite ) theory of trailing noise from rotating blade has been validated by comparison with a new formulation that implicitly includes acceleration effects . \\n the results presented in this paper show that the modified form of schlinker and amiet s predicts sound pressure levels within 1  db of our new formulation for subsonic chordwise mach numbers of up to 0.95 at high frequencies ( @xmath283 and @xmath282 ) . \\n it is therefore applicable to both low speed applications ( cooling fans , wind turbines ) and high speed ones ( propellers ) . \\n we propose that the correct exponent for the doppler weighting @xmath287 in schlinker and amiet s theory is @xmath288 . \\n using @xmath289 , as in  @xcite and  @xcite gives results that agree with our formulation to within 5  db . \\n however , all other things being equal , putting @xmath290 in schlinker and amiet s theory overestimates the result by up to 20  db at high mach numbers . \\n the range of validity of amiet s theory for rotating blades is currently limited to high frequencies for two reasons : it uses a high frequency blade response function and neglects the effect of blade acceleration . \\n more research is needed to identify the most important effect between the two . \\n if the effect of acceleration can be neglected , i.e. at high frequency relative to the rotational speed , amiet s theory can be extended to lower frequencies by using a low frequency blade response function ( @xcite ) . \\n taking the fourier transform of over @xmath21 , and using the far field approximation of   yields @xmath291 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 . using the jacobi - anger expansion @xmath292 which yields equation  . \\n the doppler shift indicates how the frequency of a pure tone varies for a moving observer ( relative to the source ) , compared to a fixed observer . following  @xcite , \\n an alternative physical interpretation can be obtained by observing that , for a pure tone , the pressure @xmath294 for a fixed observer and @xmath78 for a moving observer are given by @xmath295 where @xmath3 is the source frequency and @xmath4 the frequency received by the moving observer . \\n the above equation implies that the measurement of the pressure time history is sped up ( or slowed down ) , by a factor @xmath296 , for a

that @xmath299 where @xmath300 . \\n since the power spectral density ( psd ) is defined as the fourier transform of the autocorrelation , the psd @xmath301 , for a moving observer , is related to the psd @xmath302 for a fixed observer by @xmath303 i.e.    @xmath304 \\n [ fig:1_egamma_ez ] [ fig:2_ex_ey ]    we derive the chordwise mach number @xmath167 given the blade mach number @xmath305 and the
